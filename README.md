Download Images from Search Engine - intended use for datasets to train ML models

I needed image datasets to train Machine Learning Models but ImageNet was down. So I created a tool to 
(1) get me links of images
(2) download the images from the link onto my computer

I did 
(1) using python on juypter notebook, beautiful soup and selenium
(2) bash script

remember to do a quick check through on the images you have downloaded before you use the images to train the models as some images may not be accurate to the search term!
